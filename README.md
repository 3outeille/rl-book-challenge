# Understanding RL

>Reading the [RL book](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2018trimmed.pdf) the hard way.

Deep RL is [tough](http://amid.fish/reproducing-deep-rl). Before you start implementing any state of the art RL algorithm using deep neural networks, you should understand the basics. And by understand, I don't mean being able to launch jupyter notebooks and understand intuitively why it works. If you can't re-implement the basic RL algorithms it using only numpy and explain the math step by step, debugging larger models will quickly get overwhelming.

So here is my challenge: go through the entire [RL book](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2018trimmed.pdf) in **hardcore** mode:

### 1. The pseudo-code you should Numpify (cf. [numpy/](https://github.com/mtrazzi/numpankify-the-RL-book/tree/master/numpy))

Provide an implementation of all the pseudo-code in the book, using only numpy arrays.

### 2. Math should be Ankified (cf. [anki.txt](https://github.com/mtrazzi/numpankify-the-RL-book/blob/master/anki.txt))

Write down questions & answers for [Anki](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html) flashcards, and study them everyday. (I provide only the questions in [anki.txt](https://github.com/mtrazzi/numpankify-the-RL-book/blob/master/anki.txt) so everyone can write down their own answers).

### 3. Plots should be replicated (cf. [plots/](https://github.com/mtrazzi/numpankify-the-RL-book/tree/master/plots))

If there is a plot, replicate the results as closely as possible.

### 4. Exercises should be answered, even the programming ones (cf. [exercises/](https://github.com/mtrazzi/numpankify-the-RL-book/tree/master/exercises))

### 5. Your own questions you will write down (cf. [questions/](https://github.com/mtrazzi/numpankify-the-RL-book/tree/master/questions))

### 6. Through all the mathematical derivations you will go (cf. [math/](https://github.com/mtrazzi/numpankify-the-RL-book/tree/master/math))

### Exceptions

- It's OK to admit certain results if the author of the book doesn't mention them in depth (e.g. the result from stochastic approximation for equation (2.7))
