# Understanding RL

Here's the thing. I know you want to win at Dota, Starcraft or Go using DeepRL.

But you **can't**, unless you _really_ understand Reinforcement Learning.

My solution: read the [RL book](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2018trimmed.pdf) the hardcore way:

### 1. Numpify the pseudo-code ([numpy/](https://github.com/mtrazzi/numpankify-the-RL-book/tree/master/numpy))

If there is some pseudo-code, implement it using numpy arrays.

### 2. Ankify all the math ([anki.txt](https://github.com/mtrazzi/numpankify-the-RL-book/blob/master/anki.txt))

Insert definitions and important equations into your long-term memory using [Anki](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html).

### 3. Reproduce every plot ([plots/](https://github.com/mtrazzi/numpankify-the-RL-book/tree/master/plots))

If there is a plot, reproduce the results as closely as possible.

### 4. Add an answer to every exercise, even the programming ones ([exercises/](https://github.com/mtrazzi/numpankify-the-RL-book/tree/master/exercises))

### 5. Write down your own questions ([questions/](https://github.com/mtrazzi/numpankify-the-RL-book/tree/master/questions))

### 6. Go through all the derivations ([math/](https://github.com/mtrazzi/numpankify-the-RL-book/tree/master/math))

If there is some mathematical derivation, then you should do derive it by yourself, understanding every step.

### Exceptions

- It's OK to admit certain results if the author of the book doesn't mention them in depth (e.g. the result from stochastic approximation for equation (2.7))
