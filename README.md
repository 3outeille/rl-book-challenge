# Understanding RL

>Reading the [RL book](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2018trimmed.pdf) the hard way.

Deep RL is [tough](http://amid.fish/reproducing-deep-rl). Before you start implementing any state of the art RL algorithm using deep neural networks, you should understand the basics. And by understand, I don't mean being able to launch jupyter notebooks and understand intuitively why it works. If you can't re-implement the basic RL algorithms and explain the math step by step, debugging larger models will quickly get overwhelming.

So here is my challenge: go through the entire [RL book](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2018trimmed.pdf) in **hardcore** mode:

### 1. write the [code](https://github.com/mtrazzi/understanding-the-RL-book/tree/master/src) to replicate all the [figures](https://github.com/mtrazzi/understanding-the-RL-book/tree/master/fig)

### 2. solve all the [exercises](https://github.com/mtrazzi/understanding-the-RL-book/tree/master/exercises.txt)

### 3. everything you understand you should put into your long-term memory using [flashcards](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1K2B8FsxHShDDER9EXIHDrirBbXf7M2K4)
