# Understanding RL

>Reading the [RL book](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2018trimmed.pdf) the hard way.

My goal with this project is to go through the entire RL book before Friday, March 20.

### 1. Numpify the pseudo-code (cf. [numpy/](https://github.com/mtrazzi/numpankify-the-RL-book/tree/master/numpy))

Provide an implementation of all the pseudo-code in the book, using only numpy arrays.

### 2. Ankify the math (cf. [anki.txt](https://github.com/mtrazzi/numpankify-the-RL-book/blob/master/anki.txt))

Write down questions & answers for [Anki](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html) flashcards, and study them everyday. (I provide only the questions in [anki.txt](https://github.com/mtrazzi/numpankify-the-RL-book/blob/master/anki.txt) so everyone can write down their own answers).

### 3. Reproduce every plot (cf. [plots/](https://github.com/mtrazzi/numpankify-the-RL-book/tree/master/plots))

If there is a plot, reproduce the results as closely as possible.

### 4. Add an answer to every exercise, even the programming ones (cf. [exercises/](https://github.com/mtrazzi/numpankify-the-RL-book/tree/master/exercises))

### 5. Write down your own questions (cf. [questions/](https://github.com/mtrazzi/numpankify-the-RL-book/tree/master/questions))

### 6. Go through all the mathematical derivations (cf. [math/](https://github.com/mtrazzi/numpankify-the-RL-book/tree/master/math))

### Exceptions

- It's OK to admit certain results if the author of the book doesn't mention them in depth (e.g. the result from stochastic approximation for equation (2.7))
