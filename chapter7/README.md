## Figures

### Figure 7.2:

![fig7.2.png](plots/fig7.2.png)


```bash
python figures 7.2
```

### Figure 7.4:

(this figure is not in the book--I wanted to launch the off policy nstep sarsa algorithm on the windy gridworld with n greater than 2, as was suggested by the fig7.4 from the book).

```bash
python figures 7.4
```

## Sections

### Section 7.3

(implementation of the algorithm, tested with different values of n on the windy gridworld env described on section 7.3, not an actual exercise or figure)
