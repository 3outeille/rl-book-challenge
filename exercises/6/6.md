### 6.1:

G_t - V_t[S_t] = sum_{t}^{T-1} \gamma^{k-t} (\delta_k + \gamma.(V_{k+1}[S_{k+1}] - V_k[S_{k+1}])

### 6.2:

considering the driving pb., a situation where TD update might be more efficient than MC update: when i can't wait until the end of the episode to make my prediction (like, online learning for an autonomous vehicle on unknown environment). or when the MC trajectories are too difficult to sample, as they would necessit an intractable number of steps to reach the end of the episode (cf. race track example from end of chapter 5).

HINT CASE: here, with TD updates, we're updating using the correct value for "entering highway" directly, without having to simulate the entire episode. my intuition tells me that if we stay on the original scenario, then we would O(n) TD updates where only one MC update would work.
