First TD formula in tic-tac-toe
Why does the red arrow goes two steps up in the tic-tac-toe?</div></div>	"Because the opponent is kind of a <b>stochastic environment</b>. So our RL agent is trying to predict the value of reaching ""state before stochasticity in environment"".</div></div>"
How is defined the value of an action in the k-armed bandit problem?
What's the formula for estimating the true value of an action in the k-armed bandit pb?
What's the formula for the <b>greedy</b> action selection method (in k-armed bandit)?
What's the formula for the estimated action value, indexed by n, in terms of rewards?
How do you re-write the estimate of action value (indexed by n) to limit memory/computational requirements? (n+1 in function of n)
What's the general update rule used in the book? (the average hack being a special case)
How is the average called when using the formula with the step size for Q_{n+1}?	<b>exponential recency-weighted</b> average
What are the conditions on the weights (from stochastic approximation theory) to assure convergence with probability 1 of the Q values using the formula with Q_{n+1} and the step size alpha?
What's the formula for UCB?
What's the update rule for the preference of the <b>selected action </b>in the <b>Gradient Bandit Algorithm</b>?
