- When considering deterministic policies, does the Bellman equation always have an unique solution, even in the un-discounted case?

- Under which condition is it the case that if v_{\pi} satisfies the Bellman equation then \pi is optimal?

- Under which condition does a MDP has a unique optimal policy? What's the proof?

- In the undiscounted gridworld example, what happens when the initial policy has loops so policy evaluation doesn't converge?
