- [ ] How exactly do we go from \le \mathbb(E)_{\pi'}[R_{t+1} + ... + \gamma^N.R_{t+N+1} + \gamma^{N+1}.v_{\pi}(S_{t+N+1})] to \le v_{\pi'}(s) in the proof of the policy improvement? Like, what's the theorem to take the limit in the expected value here?

- [ ] How does "v_{\pi'} satisfies the Bellman equation" imply that v_{\pi'} = v*?
