for the racetrack env
---------------------

- [X] add right map from the RL book (from figure 5.5) to configs
- [X] implement noise to the racetrack env
- [X] print the trajectory between steps
  - [X] make it work sometimes
  - [X] debug index out of range
- [X] understand why for the configs/easy.txt it's sometimes blocked
- [ ] add rule of "no shortcut through empty space"
- [ ] generate trajectories for left without noise
- [ ] generate trajectories for right without noise
- [ ] generate trajectories for left with noise in learning, no noise in trajectory generation
- [ ] generate trajectories for right with noise in learning, no noise in trajectory generation
